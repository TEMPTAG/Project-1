          1. Place the Chicken Thighs in a resealable bag, or large bowl. *Chef
          note: poke a few holes in the Chicken Thighs with a fork for even
          better results
        </p>

        <p>3. Seal the bag or the bowl and place in the refrigerator</p>

          4. Allow the meat to marinate for at least an hour *Chef note: it is
          best if it is allowed to marinate overnight

        <h3>Cook the Chicken Thighs</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          1. Remove the Chicken Thighs from the refrigerator *Chef Note: Set the
          bowl or resealable bag out on the counter for 30-45min before cooking
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          2. Preheat your BBQ grill before cooking *Chef Note: the hotter the
          better, as getting a little char on the marinade really brings out the
          flavor
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>3. Sear the Chicken Thighs 2min per side on the hot grill</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          4. Cook the Chicken Thighs until they are cooked through; 165-175
          degrees internal temperature *Chef note: Chicken Thighs cook rather
          quickly on a hot grill, so keep a close eye on them
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          5. Let the Chicken Thighs rest for 10 minutes after they have been
          cooked, then serve in your favorite tacos, burritos, or as a
          stand-alone meat with your meal *Chef note: the Chicken Thighs will
          continue to cook while they rest, so make sure you plan for that in
          your cooking time and temperature
