          <p class="">
            Mason Ott, a coding bootcamp student living in Utah, juggles his
            days between decoding JavaScript bugs and deciphering the mysterious
            world of toddler tantrums, thanks to his spirited daughter. When he
            is not wrestling with lines of code or dad jokes, he is busy
            impressing his wife with his culinary masterpieces, which are mostly
            just variations of instant ramen. A gamer at heart, Mason often
            finds himself sneaking in some late-night gaming sessions,
            perfecting his skills while pretending he has got it all figured
            out. His life is a whirlwind of semicolons, snack time, and sneakily
            googling “how to be a coding wizard.”

          <h2 class="m-2 p-2 text-4xl font-medium">Jesse Anderson</h2>
          <p>
            Jesse Anderson, a coding bootcamp student and proud bachelor living
            in Utah, has the unique distinction of working in a cave—literally.
            By day, he navigates the stalagmites and stalactites of both the
            underground and the digital realm, coding away with only bats for
            company and Wi-Fi that sometimes feels prehistoric. His evenings are
            a mix of debugging code and dodging cave crickets, all while
            mastering the art of singlehood with a sense of humor as dry as the
            cave air. Jesse’s life is a comedic blend of spelunking and syntax
            errors, proving that even in the depths of a cave, one can still
            aspire to be a tech wizard.

          <h2 class="m-2 p-2 text-4xl font-medium">Ian Ferguson</h2>
          <p>
            Ian Ferguson, an Arizona resident and former race car driver, now
            channels his need for speed into the fast lane of coding bootcamp.
            Balancing life as a small-business owner, husband, and dad to a
            lively daughter and two dogs, Ian’s world is a high-octane blend of
            family fetch games and JavaScript sprints. While he no longer burns
            rubber on the track, he still finds thrills in debugging code and
            dodging toddler toys at home. With a pit crew of a loving wife, a
            spirited daughter, and two loyal canines, Ian’s life is a hilarious
            race against time, proving that whether on the track or behind a
            keyboard, he is always in the driver’s seat.
